# Generate a header file that contains an array of mappings between Unicode and
# Windows code page codepoints. The array is simply a series of 16-bit values
# in little endian byte order. For example, it can be cast to the uint16_t type
# and the index would be the Unicode code point. The returned value would then
# be the Windows code page codepoint. Depending on the code page, this value
# may be 8 bits (like CP1252), 16 bits, or either depending on the value of the
# code point (lookup how CP932 works - it is a lot like ShiftJIS). Note that
# this is Unicode code points and not encodings so UTF-8, UTF-16, etc. need to
# be parsed and converted first. To access the other mapping, Windows code page
# to Unicode codepoints, offset the array by 128KiB or 2^16 16-bit elements and
# cast the array to the uint16_t type again. The resulting header files will be
# written to the current working directory.
# url   - URL of the Unicode mapping file to download and use when generating
#         the array of mapping entries.
# cpnum - Number corresponding to the Windows code page to be used. This value

#         and the name of the array.
